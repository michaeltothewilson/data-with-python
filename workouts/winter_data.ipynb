    "### 1. __Data Foundations__\n",
    "*  __Load the Data__: Successfully import the dataset (penguins or winter olympics).\n",
    "*  __Initial Exploration__: Use `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` or `.sample()` to understand your features.\n",
    "*  __Data Cleaning__: Handle missing values (drop vs. fill) and fix any data type inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. __Visual Analysis__\n",
    "*  __Feature Distributions__: Create histograms for all numerical columns.\n",
    "*  __Correlation Matrix__: Generate a heatmap to identify relationships between variables.\n",
    "*  __Custom Insights__: Create at least 3 additional unique visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. __Machine Learning Pipeline__\n",
    "*  __ML Prep__: Define your target variable ($y$) and features ($X$)\n",
    "*  __Train/Test Split__: Divide your data (typically 80/20 or 70/30) to ensure unbiased evaluation.\n",
    "*  __Build Model__: Initialize and fit your chosen model.\n",
    "*  __Make Predictions__: Run your model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. __Evaluation & Reflection__\n",
    "*  __Quantitative Evaluation__: Calculate relevant metrics.\n",
    "*  __Visual Performance__: Plot your results\n",
    "*  __Conclusion__: Write a brief summary of what the model tells us about the data."
