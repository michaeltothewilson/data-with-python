    "Matplotlib offers two primary approaches to coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Explicit (Object-Oriented) Style:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* In this style, you create Figure and Axes objects directly and then use their methods to create plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Implicit (Pyplot) Style:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* This style relies on the `pyplot` module to automatically create and manage Figure and Axes objects.\n",
    "* You use `pyplot` functions (like `plt.plot()`, `plt.bar()`, `plt.hist()`) to add plotting elements. Matplotlib handles the underlying object creation and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simpler plotting tasks, the implicit (`pyplot`) style is often sufficient and more concise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this lesson focuses on introducing the basic plot types, we'll primarily use the `pyplot` style for its ease of use. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for more advanced or intricate visualizations, the explicit, object-oriented approach is generally recommended."

    "### 5. Customize the Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created a basic plot, you'll often want to add more information and make it visually clearer and more informative. Matplotlib provides several functions to **customize** your plots with elements like labels, titles, legends, and grid lines. Here are some of the essential customization functions available through `plt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labels:** Help viewers understand what the axes represent.\n",
    "    * **`plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')`**: Sets the label for the horizontal (x) axis. Replace `'X-axis Label'` with a descriptive name for your x-axis data.\n",
    "    * **`plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')`**: Sets the label for the vertical (y) axis. Replace `'Y-axis Label'` with a descriptive name for your y-axis data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** Provides context and summarizes the main point of the plot.\n",
    "    * **`plt.title('Plot Title')`**: Sets the title of your plot. Replace `'Plot Title'` with a concise and informative title.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Legend:** Explains what different lines, markers, or bars in your plot represent. This is especially useful when you have multiple datasets plotted on the same axes.\n",
    "    * **`plt.legend()`**: Displays the legend. For the legend to show meaningful information, you need to have included a `label` argument when you initially called your plotting functions (e.g., `plt.plot(x, y, label='Data Series A')`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grid:** Adds grid lines to the plot, which can make it easier to read the values on the axes.\n",
    "    * **`plt.grid(True)`**: Turns the grid lines on. You can also customize the appearance of the grid (e.g., line style, color) by passing additional arguments to this function.\n",
