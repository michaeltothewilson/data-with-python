    "### How Can We Improve This Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen a basic model in action, the next exciting step is to think about **how we could make it even better**. Consider these questions and discuss them with your classmates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Could we get more data?** Often, having more diverse and relevant data can help a model learn better patterns and make more accurate predictions, especially if your current dataset is small or doesn't cover all scenarios.\n",
    "2.  **Could we use a different type of model?** Linear Regression assumes a straight-line relationship. What if the relationship between features and house prices isn't a straight line? (Hint: In `sklearn`, explore `ensemble` models like Decision Trees or Random Forests, or even `neural_network` models).\n",
    "3.  **Are all the features equally important?** Should we try to use all the features, or could some be combined or transformed? (Hint: Sometimes creating new features from existing ones – this is called \"feature engineering\" – or selecting only the most impactful ones can improve results).\n",
    "4.  **Does the \"scale\" of our data matter?** Some features like 'population' are very large numbers, while others like 'average rooms' are small. Could this difference in scale affect how the model learns? (Hint: Look into 'feature scaling' or 'normalization' techniques in `sklearn.preprocessing`).\n",
    "5.  **How could we be more sure our model isn't just \"memorizing\" the training data?** Our model works okay on the test set, but what if it just got \"lucky\" on this particular split? How can we make our evaluation more robust? (Hint: Research 'cross-validation' techniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few ideas to get you thinking about the exciting next steps in improving machine learning models."
